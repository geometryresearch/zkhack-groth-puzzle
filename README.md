# Geometry presents: the Groth16 Malleability Challenge

## Preamble

[Groth16](https://eprint.iacr.org/2016/260) proofs are very popular and are
used by many protocols in production. Libraries such as
[`snarkjs`](https://github.com/iden3/snarkjs) and
[`ark-groth`](https://github.com/arkworks-rs/groth16) do a good job abstracting
proof systems and providing a nice interface for writing circuits. Nevertheless
in order to write sound and safe protocols, it's very important to understand
deeper cryptographic concepts. 


## The challenge

When learning about cryptographic protocols, it's extremely valuable to learn
about potential attacks and problems, and the best way to learn is by
attempting. To that end, Geometry Research is conducting The Groth16
Malleability Challenge. Any intrepid hackers who complete this challenge will
earn a special NFT sponsored by Geometry. We provide a modified version of
`snarkjs` which makes malleable proofs possible; your task is to modify a proof
such that it remains valid but one of its public inputs differs.

### Criteria

There is a challenge contract deployed at
[`0x5cf96D3b9f85A0B1C478eaCe65970B246e2283b7`](https://etherscan.io/address/0x5cf96D3b9f85A0B1C478eaCe65970B246e2283b7)
on the Ethereum mainnet. It exposes a `solve()` function which accepts a
Groth16 proof. The proof corresponds to the circuit described below. `solve()`
will call a verifier function which will use the caller's Ethereum address as
the first public input `a`.

If the verification passes, the contract will mint a non-transferable prize NFT
to the caller.

## The circuit

The circuit code can be found here: [`circuits/circuit.circom`](circuits/circuit.circom).

All `zkey` files are already in `build/snark/circuit` folder, so please do not
build it again, as it will make it incompatible with the verifying key in the
contract.

## `snarkjs` modifications

This puzzle cannot be solved without tiny modifications to `snarkjs`. 
If you take a closer look in `dependency` section of `package.json` you'll see that [this `snarkjs`
fork](https://github.com/geometryresearch/snarkjs/) is used and it only differs
in one line:

```diff
diff --git a/build/main.cjs b/build/main.cjs
index 00e6965..ef1bd6f 100644
--- a/build/main.cjs
+++ b/build/main.cjs

             }
         }
 
-        for (let s = 0; s <= nPublic ; s++) {
+//         for (let s = 0; s <= nPublic ; s++) {
+        for (let s = 0; s < 1 ; s++) {
             const l1t = TAU_G1;
             const l1 = sG1*(r1cs.nConstraints + s);
             const l2t = BETATAU_G1;
```

That's correct â€” with a modification to only one line, malleable proofs
can be crafted.

## Submitting your proof

In `src/solution.js` there is a template for creating a malleable proof. You
can run it with ```npm run solve```. As expected, it fails, and your task will
be to make it work. 

Step 1: Make sure that the wallet address you put in:  

```js 
const new_a = BigInt("PUT_YOUR_ADDRESS_HERE");
```

matches the address you plan to submit proof with!. 

Step 2: Do some magic on proof such that script runs with no errors and you will get output like this: 

```
[9033671481509310303480432375584986467146091997413160063526744094065848123115,1134048701020180641101291596483848464593285629853388726406614166877915275766,9735231883876420451920486462692839352481483823164847775245009097080002888605,18840452748006100068490126604883025783982577474616558019215463905727488555872,10499146114916491429815578549277100422153716639543017208844093487768363764387,7254171176247254130704409555297684571142738087816156016743992872816776219110,19434752999601924861048365747389278784362237409704016406266170338427127573370,2667505953663721770463958924381297083990119574041705395843873986309548427123]
```

Next, navigate to the verifier contract page on 
[`Etherscan`](https://etherscan.io/address/0x5cf96D3b9f85A0B1C478eaCe65970B246e2283b7),
connect your web3 wallet (using the account whose address is the first public
input), and submit the above formatted proof to the `solve()` textbox. Click on
"Write" to submit your transaction.

If your transaction succeeds, you will receive a non-transferable prize NFT.
Congratulations!

## Refund Policy

When you invoke the contract's `solve()` function via a transaction, the
contract will provide a gas refund. 

```js
    // Perform the gas refund
    // 28521 was estimated using Remix
    uint256 gasSpent = gasBefore - gasleft() + 28521;
    address payable sender = payable(msg.sender);

    uint gaspice = tx.gasprice < refundingGasPrice ? tx.gasprice : refundingGasPrice;
    sender.transfer(gasSpent * gaspice);
```

Just make sure that `gasprice` you specify is no larger than
`refundingGasPrice` in the contract. This is the upper bound that we are
willing to refund. Please also note that if there is high volatility in
gas prices, just be patient. We will make sure to adapt `refundingGasPrice`
such that your transaction gets executed as quickly as possible.
